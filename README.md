Sidebander is a Eurorack module that employs additive synthesis to create FM synthesis sounds.

FM synthesis, known for its complexity, is made more accessible and performance-friendly with Sidebander.

The inspiration for Sidebander originated from the "tone clusters" famously utilized by Penderecki, which its developer discovered through the collaborative works of Radiohead's guitarist, Johnny Greenwood, with Penderecki. The developer of Sidebander eventually recognized a fascinating link between these tone clusters and FM synthesis.

Intriguingly, FM synthesis naturally produces sidebands that deviate from a carrier wave's fundamental frequency, mirroring the concept of equally spaced tone clusters in an unexpected way. Furthermore, when these sidebands are exceptionally close to the fundamental frequency, they create effects akin to unison or chorusing.

Sidebander offers a novel approach to exploring sonic landscapes, enabling users to extract pure waveforms, unison effects, FM-like sounds, and tone clusters, all within a single, versatile module.
